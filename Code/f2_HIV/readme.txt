1. use matlab file to generate trainset and  testset. Both the trainset and testset are generated by the same way by using matlab files, though different run. The testset are 50 samples from the tail (the most variable part) of another generated dataset, separated, put into the folder.

2. the testset is evaluated by eval. py to generate the figures

3. the dynamics are too similar in this dataset, but pay attention to the y-axis, it changes fast
