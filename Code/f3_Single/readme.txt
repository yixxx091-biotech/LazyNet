1. use matlab files to generate both the trainset and testset (another run). Both the trainset and testset are generated by the same way by using matlab files, though different run. 

2. use lazynet1_1.py and trainset062624_1.txt to generate the no.82 model.

3. use testprep1.py and testset063024_1.txt to generate 500 dots folder name as testset063024_1.

4. use batcheval.py to evaluate them into 500dots folder.
